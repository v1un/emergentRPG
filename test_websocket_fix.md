# WebSocket Disconnection Fix Test Results

## Issue Description
WebSocket connections were disconnecting immediately when navigating between game panels (inventory, character, etc.) in the emergentRPG frontend.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Multiple WebSocket managers**: Both `WebSocketManager` and individual components using `useGameWebSocket` were managing connection lifecycle
2. **Component unmounting**: When navigating between panels, components would unmount and trigger WebSocket disconnection
3. **beforeunload event**: The `GameWebSocketService` was listening to `beforeunload` events which can trigger during SPA navigation

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added `manageConnection` flag**: Only `WebSocketManager` component manages connection lifecycle
2. **Removed redundant cleanup**: Eliminated duplicate cleanup effects
3. **Removed beforeunload listener**: Prevents disconnections during SPA navigation
4. **Centralized connection management**: Only one component controls WebSocket lifecycle

## Code Changes Made
1. `frontend/src/hooks/useGameWebSocket.ts`:
   - Added `manageConnection` option
   - Modified cleanup effect to only disconnect when `manageConnection=true`

2. `frontend/src/components/game/WebSocketManager.tsx`:
   - Set `manageConnection: true`
   - Removed redundant cleanup effect

3. `frontend/src/hooks/useGameAction.ts`:
   - Set `manageConnection: false` and `autoConnect: false`

4. `frontend/src/services/websocket/gameWebSocket.ts`:
   - Removed `beforeunload` event listener

## Test Results
- **Before fix**: WebSocket disconnected within seconds of connection
- **After fix**: WebSocket connections remain stable during panel navigation
- **Backend logs**: Show persistent connections without unexpected disconnections

## Verification
Check backend logs at `logs/backend.log` for WebSocket connection stability:
```
2025-05-27 23:21:35,122 - WebSocket connected: session=demo-session-1748398639040
2025-05-27 23:21:35,124 - WebSocket connected: session=demo-session-1748398874928
# No disconnection messages following these connections
```

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - WebSocket connections now remain stable during navigation between game panels.
