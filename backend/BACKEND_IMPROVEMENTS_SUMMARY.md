@monitor_performance("database_query")
async def query_database():
    # Database operation
    pass

async with monitor_operation("ai_generation", {"model": "gemini"}):
    # AI operation
    pass
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
```python
from utils.exceptions import DatabaseError, SessionSaveError

try:
    await db_service.save_game_session(session)
except SessionSaveError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to save session: {e.error_code} - {e.message}")
    # Handle specific error type
```

### Configuration Access
```python
from config.settings import settings

# Access structured configuration
db_config = settings.database
ai_config = settings.ai

# Legacy compatibility maintained
mongo_url = settings.MONGO_URL
```
